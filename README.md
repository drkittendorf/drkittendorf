While I had spent some time as a Library Web Master in the early 2000s and it continued to be an interest to me, it wasn't until the last couple years with the rapid development of technology, especially Virtual Reality and the expansive impact of cybersecurity that I really began to imagine the possibilities and that roots of my lifelong interest in technology really began to bloom. After leading the development of a local streaming music collection for Austin Public Library, I knew I wanted to get out and really explore the possibilities of the web, multimedia and technology in general.
