  While I had spent some time as a Library Web Master in the early 2000s and I continued to be involved with the internet and databases, helping implement new technologies at libraries, it wasn't until the rapid development of technology within last few years, especially around Virtual Reality, Cybersecurity and personal privacy that I began to really imagine the possibilities. After leading the development of a local streaming music collection for Austin Public Library, I knew I wanted to get out and really explore the possibilities of the web, multimedia and technology in general.
  I have been fortunate enough to attend SXSW for the last 5 years and get peaks at the waves of developing technology, and that definitely contributed to my career shift. The roots of my lifelong interest in technology really began to take hold and drove me to the decision of signing up for Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at the University of Texas.  
  I am committed to learning new skills, technologically and team based, to continue my development as a programmer and as a contributing team member. 
  Hopefully the projects you see here will reflect some of that desire and continuous growth. Thanks for stopping by! <br>
  Dale
